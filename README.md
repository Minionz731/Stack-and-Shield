## 🧠 Why Stack & Shield

Most digital products fail because they are:

* Built fast but not **built smart**
* Pretty but not **secure**
* Live today but **broken tomorrow**

Stack & Shield exists to fix that.

We believe:

* Security is **not optional**
* Systems should scale without chaos
* Technology should serve people — ethically and intelligently
